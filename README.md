# PiWallet

PiWallet is a Next.js application designed to securely manage your credentials using Solana wallet integration. The project leverages Prisma for database management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

You can start editing the application by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
